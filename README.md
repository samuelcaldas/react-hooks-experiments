# React Hooks experiments

This is a simple project to demonstrate my learning with React Hooks.

## What are the experiments in this project?

This project contains four experiments that show how to use some of the most common and useful React Hooks:

- useState: A hook that lets you add state to function components
- useEffect: A hook that lets you perform side effects in function components
- useContext: A hook that lets you access and update context data in function components
- useSWR: A hook that lets you fetch and cache data from an API

Each experiment has its own page with a description and a code example. You can navigate between the pages using the links in the header.
